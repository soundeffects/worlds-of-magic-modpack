Welcome to a World of Magic, waiting to be explored.
Choose your specialty and conquer.

Before you start:
You have to worry about temperature and water. Shift-right-click water blocks with an empty hand to drink.
You're going to want to craft an axe using flint and sticks, since punching wood won't give you any logs.
Animals are vicious, you may not want to attack them.
Monsters don't spawn on the surface, so you don't have to worry about nightfall.

Warning: this pack is semi-hardcore. You only have five respawns before you are banned from the world,
be careful.

Now you are ready to begin your adventure. Once you feel comfortable with survival,
check out your advancements to learn how to progress further.
