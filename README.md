# Worlds of Magic
## Summary
This is a modpack I've always wanted to put together, focused on being able to choose the magic mod (or group of magic mods)
that suits your playstyle. You will have to learn how to play to the strengths and overcome the limitations of your school,
instead of traditional kitchen-sink style modpacks where you would simply switch to a different mod when problems become tough
to solve. You can then compare your setups to others who have chosen different schools than you, and see how they have solved
their problems.

## Features
- Eight schools of magic to choose from including:
  - Alchemy, centered around the Thaumcraft mod.
  - Astral Projection, centered around Mystcraft other dimension mods (such as Aether).
  - Astrology, centered around the Astral Sorcery mod.
  - Divination, centered around the mod Botania.
  - Druidry, centered around the Roots mod.
  - Technomancy, centered around both Embers and Psi mods.
  - Witchcraft, centered around the Bewitchment mod.
  - Wizardry, centered around Electroblob's Wizardry.
- A dynamic and realistic world, including realistic terrain gen, dynamic trees, growing animal populations, and more.
