# Worlds of Magic
## Summary
This is a modpack I've always wanted to put together, focused on being able to choose the magic mod (or group of magic mods)
that suits your playstyle. You will have to learn how to play to the strengths and overcome the limitations of your school,
instead of traditional kitchen-sink style modpacks where you would simply switch to a different mod when problems become tough
to solve. You can then compare your setups to others who have chosen different schools than you, and see how they have solved
their problems.
